Key Features:

•	VHDL Coding for Digital Circuits: All projects are developed using VHDL to describe the functionality and behavior of various digital components such as gates, multiplexers, adders, and counters.
•	Simulation with Quartus II and ModelSim: The projects make use of Quartus II for circuit design and ModelSim for functional simulation, allowing for testing and verification of digital systems.
•	FPGA Implementation: Many of the circuits are implemented on FPGA boards, providing real-world testing and validation for designs.


Projects Include:
1.	Basic Logic Gates - Implementation of basic logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.
2.	Combinational Circuits - Design of multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders, and decoders.
3.	Flip-Flops and Registers - Design and implementation of SR, JK, D, and T flip-flops, as well as registers for data storage.
4.	Counters - Both synchronous and asynchronous counters, including up, down, and up/down counters.
5.	Arithmetic Circuits - Full adders, half adders, binary and BCD adders, and subtractors for arithmetic operations.
6.	State Machines - Finite State Machines (FSM) design, including simple examples for sequential logic control.



Tools and Software:
•	Quartus II: For designing and synthesizing digital circuits.
•	ModelSim: For simulating the VHDL code and verifying the functionality of the designs.
•	FPGA Hardware: The final designs are downloaded onto FPGA boards for hardware implementation and verification.

This repository serves as a practical guide for learning digital design using VHDL and implementing it on FPGA hardware. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced learner, this repository will help you understand the key concepts and tools required to design robust digital systems.
